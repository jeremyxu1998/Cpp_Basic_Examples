# Linked_List
This is Lab 4 of ECE244, focusing on C++ linked list implementation, where each node of linked list contains a pointer to another linked list storing resistor information.

This lab consists of C++ I/O, node & resistor network management, and node voltage calculation based on Kirchhoff law.
